# Project of CS498-HW3

## How to use it?

Every time you want to re-test analyze API, you need to clear all the contents in hw3-res-10.txt, hw3-res-11.txt and hw3-res-12.txt.

Besides, you also need to delete the q3-output10, q3-output11, q3-output12 folder manually.
Because if those files already existed, pyspark will not work!!
